# _Hack-A-Thon_

#### _A program for a Hack-A-Thon_

#### By _**Sam Gespass**_

## Description

_If anyone ever wants to start a hackathon and get written on some kind of terrorist watchlist, you can clone this and get started. NOTE: I do not take responsibility for what anyone does with this software. In fact, I would prefer you not actually use it. Or use it for something different. You can make a bunny website. I like bunnies. They're cute._

_Anyway, this app allows a user to create a team for a Hack-A-Thon. You can add members as well. I've made sure there are ways to do everything one would need to do to keep track of teams, including adding and deleting members._
